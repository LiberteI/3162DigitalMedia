Included are four MATLAB function files with the following purposes:

- genTree.m implements the computation of Huffman trees. It accepts as input
  either a list of symbols with corresponding frequencies, or a string from
  which such a list is computed.  The code extensively uses cell arrays;
  please take a few moments to read up on them in the Matlab documentation.
  You may also want to read up on strings (which in Matlab are character
  arrays). Trees are implemented as cell arrays with the root node's label in
  the first and the left and right subtrees in the second and third positions.

- Huffman.m implements the recursive algorithm for generating Huffman trees.
  It is called from genTree.m and does most of the work.
  
- encode.m takes as inputs a string and a code tree and returns the code for
  the given string.

- decode.m takes as inputs a code word and a code tree and recovers the
  encoded string.
  
There are two further MATLAB scripts included in the archive that implement examples.  Please note the following important points:

- The provided code is useless as is as it stores code symbols as 16-bit
  characters.  In order to be useful, the character strings would need to be
  converted to bit fields, reducing storage requirements by a factor of
  sixteen.  I didn't bother, but when computing compression rates, please
  assume a bit field representation.

- There is no error checking, for example for when a code tree does not
  contain a symbol that is to be encoded.  Don't worry about it, but make sure
  you use the code appropriately.

- Carriage returns and other special characters are not encoded.  When
  computing compression rates, make sure you consider only those symbols that
  are actually encoded.

- I have made no attempt to optimize the code for efficiency.

To explore the code that is provided, you may use the simple example provided
in simple.m.  larger.m implements the larger example.
